# Frequently asked questions

## For how many passengers can I book a trip?

On most routes we offer trips for 1-7 passengers. On some routes we offer trips for up to 10 passengers. If you need to book a trip for more passengers please create multiple bookings.

## After receiving trip options, how much time do I have to book one of them?

Returned trip options will expire in 1 hour. Customizing an option with stops won't change it's expiration time.

## Can I cancel a booking created via the API?

Yes, you can cancel a booking if it's departure is more than 24 hours in the future - this threshold is a subject to change.

## Once a booking is created, can it be cancelled or changed by Daytrip?

No, once a booking is created by calling our API, it is confirmed and guaranteed by Daytrip to be fulfilled. You do not need to subscribe to any booking status changes.

## Does the Daytrip API handle payments?

No, the Daytrip API does not handle payments. You are responsible for collecting online payments from the customers. You are also responsible for any currency conversion for display purposes (currently the API will return prices in EUR or USD based on the country of the trip). Your company will be invoiced by Daytrip for the trips you book with us.
