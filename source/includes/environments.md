# Environments

Daytrip offers a sandbox environment where you can test your integration with the API without creating real bookings. All the code examples provided in this documentation are using this sandbox environment. Each environment requires a different API key. When your integration is ready and tested against the sandbox environment, you can request an API key for the production environment.
