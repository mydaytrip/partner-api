## Daytrip Partner API

**DISCLAIMER: SEARCH AND BOOK ENDPOINTS ARE READY FOR INTEGRATION. OTHER ENDPOINTS WILL BE READY IN THE FOLLOWING WEEKS.**

The Daytrip API is organized around REST. Our API accepts JSON-encoded request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes and verbs.

The API can be used to search for trip options, customize a trip with stops, book a trip, get details about a booking or cancel a booking.
